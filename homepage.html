      <h5 class="cookingranch-center">From Farm To Table</h5>
      <p class="cookingranch-large">Healthy, hearty, and tasteful meals are one of the simple joys that many people cannot live without. 
      There are countless food combinations, techniques, and unique cooking styles that can transform simple food ingredients into a meal. Our recipes 
      are created to be very simple and brief so our viewers can easily cook healthy meals without complications and extra steps that will discourage them 
      from making a desired dish. Through these simple objectives, we hope The Cooking Ranch is the next step into creating a healthier diet in local communities everywhere.</p>
      <p class="cookingranch-large">The founders of The Cooking Ranch consist of four representatives, Alexis Conlon, Antonio Avila, Farrah Nazmi, and Karina Estrin, who all came from different 
      backgrounds. Each of us are equally passionate about preparing healthful meals. We believe that a healthy diet plays a significant role in a more productive lifestyle and wanted to create a 
      platform from which we could share the recipes we have discovered and tested that we believe to be very nutritious, yet simple to prepare on a day-to-day basis. In response to the current 
      tragedies of COVID-19, our team strives to create The Cooking Ranch website to connect friends, families, and loved ones through the love of cooking.</p>
